# Learning all about Chorus!

We are trying to strike a balance between making the setup process as easy and fool proof as possible with the need to not _hide_ too much of the interactions between the projects that make up Chorus.

If you are impatient, we have a quick start script, `./quickstart.sh` that sets you up, however I recommend you go through [Kata 0: Setting up Chorus](katas/000_setting_up_chorus.md).   

After that, you can learn how to use the tools in Chorus to improve search in [First Kata: Lets Optimize a Query](katas/001_optimize_a_query.md).




# How to restart

To reset your environment, just run:
```
docker-compose down -v
git checkout volumes/preliveCore/conf/rules.txt
```

Note: this will reset the MySQL database, and then reset you Querqy rules.
